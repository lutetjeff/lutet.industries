## what are my educational/career goals?

I'd like to balance my desire to keep educating myself with doing something meaningful with my career.

I'm not really a complete non-believer in academia though, so I'm going to pursue a graduate degree.

Most likely that will be a 1.5-year continuation of my undergrad at UIUC, with a M.S. in ECE. 

If I finish my undergrad a year early (as intended, in May 2026), I should finish my master's degree by December 2027.

Ph.D is on the table but unlikely.

## what is a lutet and why is it industries

This is somewhat of a long story. Back in 8th grade, I started a Minecraft creative server with my friends where we
were each assigned some territory, and we roleplayed as the governors of our respective territories, with congress, housing,
transportation, infrastructure, things of that sort. Originally, we designated a bunch of regions based on geographical features and gave
the regions to each player. My first region was called Hanatia, a variant of the european region [Banat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banat).
A few months in, and I had pretty much run out of coastline to build more stuff. So I looked into expanding into the next region, where the player
there had never really been active. That region was called **Lutet**, named after [Lutetia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutetia).
All of my better builds and my government offices eventually moved over to Lutet,
and a few months later we merged the two regions into a state called Lutet-Hanatia. In government, my friends and I called each other
by our state names for convenience sake, and so when we were on the server, my friends started calling me lutet. I got curious, realized that Minecraft
username had not been taken yet, and switched my username to that. 

I like the name lutet because it is short, memorable, and relatively underutilized on the internet. So if you look up lutet my socials come up pretty quickly.

Why industries? I'm not completely sure but when I was first building custom PCBs I wanted to mark them like Adafruit did and Adafruit's full name is Adafruit Industries.
Hence, **lutet industries**.

## why do you play rhythm games
tl;dr friend kept telling me to play osu and i got so annoyed i downloaded the game, got better than him, and sniped every single one of his scores

nowadays I'm more chill though, still a competitive spirit but more formally (like through tournaments and esports and what not) 

I choose to play rhythm games rather than other types of games as it's typically a very skill-based game. learning a new game gives me tons of dopamine just to get better, keeps the mind sharp,
and sometimes can help me get exercise. (ITG and beat saber)

here is a (incomplete) list of rhythm games I have played a decent amount (>10 hours):
- osu!standard
- 4k vsrg (osu!mania, quaver, etterna)
- 6k vsrg (osu!mania)
- 7k vsrg (osu!mania)
- osu!taiko
- maimai
- chunithm
- taiko no tatsujin
- a dance of fire and ice
- 4-panel dance games (DDR, ITG) thank you [carter](https://x.com/CarterTheQ) and evan for getting me into this
- pop'n music
- beat saber
